Hello,

My name is Ahmed Tarek and this is the GAN assignement that was requested on the Fashion MNSIT dataset after completting the WE Advanced AI training

Here are some information that you need to know :

1- This GAN was created on Kaggle notebooks so the PyTorch Lighining library was already installed

2- If you are going to run the notebook on COLAB you may install the library first using the command line : !pip install pytorch-lightning

3- there is also the Python file version for the code if you would like to run it localy however also make sure that you have installed all the requirements

4- you can change the number of epochs for more accurracy, the processes does not take long time as it uses the GPU as accelerator

5- DO NOT forget to use the GPU while running the note book

6- To see the final resault after the training run the cell with the code : model.plot_imgs()


Feel free to report any issues or to give your opinion about it :)
